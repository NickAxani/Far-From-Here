# Far From Here

## 📌 Overview
Far From Here is a 3D survival game with horror elements. The player is lost in a forest where they need to survive and attempt to make their way back to civilization.

## 🕹️ Core Gameplay
Player survives by scavenging the forest for food and water.  
Player needs to avoid or eliminate threats like animals and other cryptid or eldritch entities.  
The player can find hunting rifles and ammo in abandoned cabins and watchtowers to do the above.  
The goal of the player is to reach an extraction point, they learn the location of through items like a radio, GPS and compass.  
The radio gives coordinates and a direction from those coordinates, the gps tells the player what their coordinates are and the compass gives the direction of the player.  
They lose when their hit points reach 0, through starvation, dehydration or enemy entities attacking the player.  

## 🎯 Game Type
Survival and Horror

## 👥 Player Setup
Single player as the survivor.  
Optional co-op where 1-3 additional player(s) can join the same world and attempt to reach the extraction together.  

## 🤖 AI Design
### Enemy Entity FSM.  
Roaming, walks around aimlessly.  
Alerted through sound, tracks, or previously sighted player.  
Chasing player.  
Attacking player.  
Searching for previously sighted player.  
Fleeing, animals will flee at low hp (not including cryptid or eldritch entities).  

## 🎬 Scripted Events
When player gets all 3 items (radio, GPS and compass) spawns extraction point in the world.  
When the player picks up the radio (or clicks on it again) it will play a recording with a coordinate and a direction from that coordinate.  
Quick time event when an enemy attacks a player, they will continously take damage during the quick time event.  
Player succesfuly makes it to extraction plays win cutscene.  

## 🌍 Environment
As large as a forest as can be reasonably made and filled.  
NavMesh baked for AI pathing.  
Trees, rocks and abandoned structures have colliders.  

## 🧪 Physics Scope
Rigidbody on player(s) and enemies.  
Colliders and triggers on environment and entities.  
Raycast for player shooting firearm.  
Physics materials for items being dropped (food, rations, weapons and objective items).  
Layer-based collision matrix hit and hurt boxes, world static, interaction range.  
Simple ragdoll or flail on death of player or enemy.  

## 🧠 FSM Scope
State machines implemented for player and enemies.  
Event driven transitions using Unity events and C# events.   
Debug overlay that prints current states for grading.  

## 🧩 Systems and Mechanics
Player survives by keeping their hit points above 0, which requires consuming food and water as well as avoiding danger.  
Player can obtain a firearm and a knife to protect themselves, eliminating enemies from range or having easier quick time events at close range.  
Player wins by extracting after collecting all Objective items that point towards an extraction point.  
Object tagging Weapon, Consumable, Objective
Camera first person.  
Audio cues of danger nearby with intense "battle" music or enemy sounds.  
VFX blood when the player takes damage, effects on the horror elemnts time permitting.  

## 🎮 Controls (proposed)
W A S D move.  
Shift sprint.  
Mouse look.  
Space jump.  
F interact pick up, open and close door.  
Left Mouse shoot.  
Right Mouse aim down sights.  
Esc pause.  

## 📂 Project Setup aligned to course topics
Unity 6.0 (6000.0.58f1 LTS).  
C# scripts for PlayerController, EnemyAIController, Consumables, ObjectiveItems, InventoryController, ExtractionController.  
NavMesh for AI pathing.  
Animator controllers for player and enemies with parameters speed, isAttacking, isWalking, isRunning.  
Physics materials and layers configured in Project Settings.  
GitHub Classroom repository with regular commits and meaningful messages.  
Readme and in game debug UI showing FPS, state names, and safety meter for assessment.  


# A2

# Controls
W A S D for movement  
mouse to look around (first person)  
left shift to sprint (hold)  
space to jump  
left ctrl to crouch (toggle)  
f3 for debug mode, states and enemy vision  

# Player states (Not traditional FSM since it's not states with transitions, rather states in a checklist order)
used for speed and to be used for animation, ordered in check order  
  
crouchwalking - grounded + crouched + moving  
sprinting - grounded + sprint key + moving  
walking - grounded + moving  
crouching - grounded + crouched + not moving  
idle - grounded + not moving  
in air - not grounded  

# Enemy states
Roaming - chooses random nearby place and moves towards that point  
&emsp;	spots player -> Chasing  
Chasing - runs toward player targeted  
&emsp;	stops seeing player -> Searching  
&emsp;	within attack range -> Attacking  
Attacking - attacks player targeted  
&emsp;	stops seeing player -> Searching  
&emsp;	player becomes out of attack range -> Chasing  
Searching - looks for player where last seen  
&emsp;	spots player -> Chasing  
&emsp;	5 seconds pass -> Roaming
